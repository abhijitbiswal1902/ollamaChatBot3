## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Tips

Use these tips to get better results from the chatbot:

- **Be specific**:  
  ✅ `Summarize section 2 of the uploaded PDF in bullet points.`  
  ❌ `What's in this document?`  

- **Ask for structured output**:  
  `Provide the data as a table.`  
  `Respond in JSON format.`  

- **Give clear file context**:  
  `Based on the sales.xlsx file, what are the top 3 regions by profit?`  

- **Use follow-ups to dive deeper**:  
  `Now compare that with last quarter's performance.`  
  `List only the items with revenue above 10,000.`

## 🧩 Troubleshooting
